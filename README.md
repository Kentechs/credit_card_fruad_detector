Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The dataset includes anonymized transaction data, which allows for building models that can detect fraud effectively without compromising user privacy.

Data
Source: The dataset consists of anonymized financial transactions.
Features:
Time and transaction amount (Amount) features.
28 principal components derived from the original features.
Class is the target label, with 1 indicating fraud and 0 indicating non-fraud.
Dependencies
To set up the environment, use the following command to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main libraries used:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
Project Structure
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load data and inspect its structure, including data types and missing values.
Generate basic plots to understand the distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
Data Preprocessing:

Standardize the Amount feature using RobustScaler to handle outliers.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions.
Analyze feature distributions and correlations to gain insights into fraudulent behavior.
Model Training:

Train multiple classifiers, including:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Use cross-validation and AUC scores to evaluate and select the best model.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the selected model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Plot confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves for detailed performance analysis.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
cd fraud-detection
Run the Notebook: Open the notebook and execute each cell sequentially to load data, preprocess, train, and evaluate models.

Model Evaluation: Review the final evaluation metrics and visualizations at the end of the notebook to understand model performance.

Results
Model Performance: The best model achieved an AUC score of [insert model’s score].
EDA Insights: Key features that help in identifying fraud include high-risk principal components identified during the EDA phase.
Future Improvements
Ensemble Techniques: Apply ensemble methods to improve classification accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Include additional features if available to enhance model predictive power.
Deployment: Implement a real-time detection system using this model.
